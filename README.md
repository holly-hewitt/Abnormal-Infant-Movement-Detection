# Abnormal Infant Movement Detection

## Introduction

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a prevalent condition, affecting approximately 1 in 400 individuals in the United Kingdom, thus underscoring its societal impact. Early diagnosis of CP holds immense significance, as interventions during infancy take advantage of heightened brain plasticity, leading to substantial improvements. Current diagnostic methods involve expensive scans and Movement Assessment, the latter requiring extensive clinician training and being susceptible to subjectivity and observer fatigue. This project explores the integration of machine learning techniques for the automated analysis of infant movement data as a promising alternative, aiming to identify infants at risk of developing developmental disorders like CP and contributing to more efficient diagnostic processes.

## Project Overview

### Dataset

The dataset comprises 21 Typically Developing Infants and 13 infants at risk of developing CP due to Perinatal Stroke, confirmed through MRI. Axivity WAX9 IMU sensors were strategically placed on wrists and ankles, capturing monthly data from term age to 6 months. Each session involved ten-minute recordings with infants lying supine, and each trial was meticulously annotated by a clinician with movement assessment results.

### Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of automatically predicting movement assessment results from sensor data. Leveraging the collected dataset, our approach involves the training and testing of these models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing infants at risk of developmental disorders, particularly CP.
